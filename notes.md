- Redux is a pattern for organizing global state in your application outside of react components tree 
- The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
  - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
  - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
  - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
